For each idea I answer the following questions:
1. Is this a real problem that someone would care about?
2. Is there real data available?
3. Is the data easy to acquire and clean?

Idea #1: Bike sharing in Washington DC

As the readme suggests I would construct a model to predict usage of the system by day (think climate conditions and whether or not it is a holiday) and hourly statistics (if someone picks up a bike at the national mall, how long will they use it on average?). 
1. Understanding the merits and usage statistics of a bike sharing system, as well as the potential benefits to reducing traffic congestion and increasing public health, could be a boon to major city centers around the globe. 
2. Real data is available from the UCI machine learning repository.
3. The data is freely available via this link: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00275/

Taking things a step further: We could compare the DC bikeshare system to other bike sharing systems around the world, and compare the usage statistics with traffic data in the different cities to learn if a more

Idea #2: Safety ratings of cars in the 1980s
Here I would construct a model to verify the signaling to answer the question: “Are +3 signaled cars actually more safe than +1 signaled cars?” and more questions and modeling problems will certainly arise after data exploration.

1. The safety ratings, or signaling as actuaries call it, are an invaluable tool for both insurance companies and potential buyers looking for the perfect combination of comfort, style, and safety. 
2. Real data is available from the UCI machine learning repository.
3. The data is freely accessible via this link: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Automobile

Taking things a step further: We could compare the ratings of these brands from the 80s and compare them with the modern day and see how different companies have improved both in the data sets, and in the public eye.

Idea #3: Mercedes-Benz Greener Manufacturing

This is a past kaggle competition where the goal is to reduce the time that cars in development spend in the testing bench. The goal is to make a model that predicts the time the car needs on the test bench to pass testing. 

1. Reducing cycle time, or in this case testing time, is always near the top of the priority list for any manufacturing firm, Mercedez-Benz is no exception.
2. Real data is readily available from kaggle.
3. The data is freely available at this link: https://www.kaggle.com/c/mercedes-benz-greener-manufacturing/data

Taking things a step further: We could compare the testing of Mercedez-Benz to the testing of Cadillac, Lexus, and BMW to set a series of benchmarks for luxury car dealerships
